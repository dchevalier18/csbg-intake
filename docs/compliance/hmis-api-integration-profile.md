# HMIS API Integration Profile

Reference for the PA HMIS (Eccovia ClientTrack/CaseWorthy) → CAP Trellis
integration.

**Status:** MOU **signed by both parties** (PA DCED 6/29/2026 · CACLV
7/27/2026, effective 7/1/2026 until terminated). **API credentials issued and
confirmed working against PA_HMIS production** (`GET /auth/test` → 200,
`SELECT TOP 5 … FROM cmClient` → 200 in 502 ms, both on 2026-08-13). Sync
engine, snapshot store, matching pass, review queue, and the organization-wide
unduplicated aggregate are **built**, now against the real transport (CTAPI —
see below). Remaining: confirm the unverified `cmClient` column names and the
`TOP`/`pageNo` interaction (list at the end), then run the first production
sync.

The transport is **CTAPI**, Eccovia's ClientTrack API
(<https://apidoc.eccovia.com>). It is **not** OAuth2: there is no token
endpoint, no bearer token, and no client-list endpoint. An earlier build of the
connection panel assumed all three; it was replaced.

## Permitted use — the operating understanding

Scope is limited to data entered by and for **CACLV-owned projects**. Per the
operating understanding between CACLV and PA HMIS (confirmed by the Homeless
Program Manager with the HMIS engineer who built the API's stored procedure):
the shared elements are pulled into CAP Trellis — a **private, internal-only
system** — for CACLV's internal tracking and reporting. That includes
importing contact information and demographics into client records. The
MOU's "deduplication" language refers to the HMIS-side stored procedure,
which returns **pre-deduplicated result sets**; on our side the matching
engine additionally deduplicates against the existing client directory so
nobody is double-counted.

Standing obligations either way: the data is never redisclosed, never used
outside the agency, stored securely with access limited to staff working on
this (admin-gated), and electronic-file disposition is coordinated with
PA DCED (procedure below). *Housekeeping note:* the MOU's written
"exclusively … deidentified aggregate reports" sentence is narrower than
this operating understanding — worth asking DCED to align the text at the
next revision so a monitoring review reads the same way both parties do.

## Data elements (per signed MOU) → where they land

| MOU element | Destination (all in the `hmis_clients` snapshot) |
|---|---|
| First name / Last name | `first` / `last` |
| Date of birth | `dob` |
| Email / Telephone | `email` / `phone` — **matching tiebreakers only** |
| **Client ID** | `hmis_id` (PK) + `client_external_ids` when linked |
| Services | `services` (jsonb name/date list) |
| Gender and Sex | `sex` (kept distinct when both provided) |
| Race / Ethnicity | `race` (combined text) |
| Veteran status | `veteran` |
| Health insurance type | `insurance` |
| Source of income | `income_src` |
| Non-cash benefits | `non_cash` |
| Family members (first/last/DOB) | `household` (jsonb list) |

**No SSN in any form.** The MOU excludes it; the system stores none.

## Sync behavior (as built)

Per HMIS person, each sync:

1. **Already linked** (`client_external_ids`, system `hmis`): fill **blank**
   fields on the linked record — phone, sex, race, veteran/military,
   insurance, income source, email (stored in `custom.email`). **Local data
   always wins**; nothing non-empty is ever overwritten.
2. **Exact identity** (normalized name + DOB, single candidate): auto-link
   (audited) + the same blank-fill.
3. **Near matches** (shared engine, `src/lib/matching.ts`; email/phone are
   tiebreakers, never keys): held in `hmis_reviews` — resolutions are
   **link**, **import as new client**, or **dismiss** (keep snapshot-only).
   Dismissals stick across syncs. Every resolution is audited.
4. **No match:** imported as a new client record — enrolled into the
   configured HMIS program (Data page setting), flagged
   "HMIS import — verify income & eligibility data" (HMIS supplies no income
   figure, so imports land at $0 income and must be verified before any
   eligibility determination), `hhSize` derived from the family-members
   list, FPL year pinned to the active schedule. Requires a DOB
   (`clients.dob` is NOT NULL) — DOB-less records stay snapshot-only.

## Aggregates (as built)

/reports shows "Organization-wide unduplicated · with PA HMIS" once a
snapshot exists: Trellis total, HMIS total (CACLV projects), matched overlap
(counted once), HMIS-only, and the unduplicated org-wide total. Counts only —
no identifying fields leave `src/lib/hmis.ts#hmisAggregate`.

## Authentication (CTAPI)

Two static headers on **every** request — no token exchange:

```
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>
Authorization: ApiKey <api key>          # literal "ApiKey ", never "Bearer"
OrgId: <org id>                          # optional; User Keys only
```

`OrgId` scopes results to one organization including its sharing agreements;
Admin Keys ignore it. Base URL is `https://api.clienttrack.net` — Prod is the
only environment the docs expose, and the `PA_HMIS` application name from the
ClientTrack login URL does **not** appear in the API URL. HTTPS only.

`GET /auth/test` is the handshake: 200 with
`{"message":"Hello CER from from the PA_HMIS ClientTrack environment."}`.
The panel surfaces the environment name from that message so staff can see
which environment they reached.

Status codes handled distinctly: **401** credentials rejected (never retried —
replaying a refused key only burns the rate limit), **404** unknown object or
path, **500/502/503/504** retried with backoff to a bounded attempt count.

## Client listing via CRQL

There is no client-list endpoint. `POST /clients` *creates* a client;
`GET /clients` does not list them. Listing goes through CRQL:

```
GET /crql?q=SELECT TOP 200 ClientID, FirstName, … FROM cmClient
        &pageNo=1&pageSize=200&shouldCache=true
```

Hard-won specifics, all verified live on 2026-08-13 — several contradict the
published docs, and the code follows what was tested:

- **`SELECT TOP n` is mandatory in practice**, though undocumented. `TOP 5` +
  `pageSize=5` answered in 502 ms, while `SELECT … FROM cmClient Order By
  ClientID` and `SELECT ClientID FROM cmClient WHERE ClientID between 1 and
  2000` both ran past 30 s and were aborted. `pageSize` alone does not bound
  the work. `crqlClientQuery()` emits `TOP` from the same effective page size
  as the `pageSize` parameter so the two cannot drift.
- **No `ORDER BY`** — the one live query that carried one timed out.
  `shouldCache=true` snapshots the result set server-side and is what keeps a
  multi-page pull coherent.
- **An empty result is a bare `{}`**, not `{"data":{"Table1":[]}}`, so
  `json.data.Table1.length` throws on any no-match query. `crqlRows()` checks
  every level.
- **`recordCount` is not trustworthy** — a `TOP 5`/`pageSize=5` read returned
  5 rows alongside `recordCount: 10`. Paging counts rows in `Table1` instead.
- **`__crql_rid` is a per-response sequence number**, not a record ID. Never
  read, never persisted.
- **`ClientID: 0`** is a system/template row and is skipped.
- `pageNo` is 1-based; `pageSize` defaults to 25 and is capped at **500**.
  `OFFSET` is rejected by the parser because paging owns that concern.
- CRQL allows **at most one join**, no subqueries, no wildcards in the field
  list, no calculated expressions, and caps the query at 2048 chars once
  URL-encoded. Anything needing multiple joins or aggregation has to be built
  in ClientTrack's Query Designer, exported as a stored procedure, and called
  through `POST /crql/storedprocedures/{name}` — not forced through CRQL.
- Single-record read: `GET /cto/cmClient/{id}` returns the full row including
  the HUD fields (`HUDRace`, `HUDEthnicity`, `VeteranStatus`,
  `DisablingCondition`, `PriorLivingSituation`, `SSNQuality`, `NameQuality`,
  `BirthDateQuality`). Not used by the sync — see the open questions.

`CRQL_CLIENT_FIELDS` in `src/lib/hmis.ts` is the single place the column list
lives. `ClientID`, `FirstName`, `LastName` and `ActiveStatus` are verified; the
demographic columns are the expected spellings and are **unverified** — a wrong
name makes CRQL answer 400 naming the column, and the 400 body is surfaced
verbatim.

## Stored procedure as the client source

The HUD elements the MOU names (`HealthInsuranceType`, `SourceOfIncome`,
`NonCashBenefits`) are not on `cmClient`, not on `Enrollment`, and CRQL permits
**at most one join** — so no single CRQL query can assemble them. Eccovia's
answer is a procedure built in ClientTrack's Query Designer, exported, and
called through `POST /crql/storedprocedures/{name}`.

**The setting is the switch.** Settings → Integrations has a *Stored procedure*
field: set it and the sync pulls from the procedure; leave it blank and the sync
uses the CRQL `cmClient` query above. There is no separate mode toggle, and the
CRQL path stays fully supported — it is the working default while Eccovia
finishes enabling our procedure.

- **The schema prefix is optional.** `C_Report_Example` and
  `dbo.C_Report_Example` both return 200 with identical payloads (verified), so
  the name is neither required to carry a prefix nor given one. It is stored
  **exactly as typed** after trimming, and sent that way — CTAPI echoes the name
  back verbatim in errors, so sending anything else makes those errors confusing.
- The name lands in a URL path segment, so validation is a security boundary:
  `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*\.[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` and nothing else. Anything
  with a slash, backslash, `?`, `#`, `%`, `..`, whitespace or a second dot is
  **rejected**, never sanitized and used anyway; the segment is URL-encoded on
  top of that.
- Parameters are a JSON object, `{}` when the procedure takes none, validated at
  save so a syntax error can't wait until sync time.
- `pageNo`/`pageSize` are documented for `/crql` only and are **not** sent here.
  Page size remains a CRQL setting.

> **This endpoint executes whatever is named.** Eccovia's own documented
> examples are write procedures (`dbo.Merge_Client`, `dbo.Delete_Client`), and
> nothing in the API distinguishes a read from a write. These credentials point
> at PA_HMIS production, so only a read-only report procedure belongs in that
> field. Test connection runs it too — that is what testing it means.

### Response handling

The stored-procedure envelope is **not** the CRQL one. Verified live (200,
~10.8 KB):

```json
{ "output": [], "result": { "table1": [ { …one object per row… } ] } }
```

`result`, not `data`. Lowercase `table1`, not `Table1`. No `recordCount`, no
`cacheExpirationDate`, no `__crql_rid`. Reading it with the CRQL spellings finds
nothing and produces a **silent zero-row sync**, which is exactly what happened.
The two endpoints therefore have two separate unwrappers — `crqlRows()` and
`procedureResult()` — rather than one helper guessing between them.

`procedureResult()` also handles, without throwing: a bare `{}` (zero rows), a
message-only body, additional result sets (`table2`, … — `table1` is used for
rows and the others are named in the sync result), and a non-empty `output`
array of procedure output parameters, which is reported rather than dropped.

### The 21 columns, and what happens to them

Keys are read **by exact string**. The payload mixes `clientID`, `firstName`,
`sexGender` and five space-separated names in one object, so there is no
convention to derive and nothing is auto-camelCased. `clientID` in particular is
not `ClientID` — the CRQL-era key list missed it, which would have dropped every
row for want of an ID even after the envelope was fixed.

Mapped to client fields: `clientID`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `dob`, `sex`,
`gender`, `sexGender`, `race`, `veteranStatus`, `insurance`,
`source of Cash Income`, `source of NonCash Income`.

Received and **not** stored, reported on every sync so this stays visible:
`enrollDate`, `exitDate`, `programName`, `relationship`, `age`,
`age at Enrollment`, `income`, `enrolled Family Members`,
`enrolled Member Count`.

- **`income` is deliberately not imported.** It would feed FPL and eligibility
  determinations; that stays a human step behind the existing "verify income &
  eligibility" flag rather than a vendor figure flowing in unchecked.
- **`enrolled Family Members` is deliberately not parsed.** Entries are
  `Last, First | MM/DD/YYYY` joined by commas, so the comma is both the
  intra-record and the inter-record separator — the split is genuinely
  ambiguous. Household composition comes from per-client rows instead.

Anything outside both lists is reported as an unmapped column, so a new column
is discovered rather than silently ignored.

### Values are labels, not HUD codes

`race` arrives as `"Black, African American, or African"`, not `3`; `insurance`
as `"Medicaid"`; `veteranStatus` as `"No"`. CAP Trellis stores CSBG AR 3.0
instrument options, and `canonicalCharacteristic()` returns null for anything it
doesn't recognize, so **the raw label is stored as-is and never coerced to a
default**. Every non-matching label is now also reported — sync result, audit
row and a `[hmis]` warning — because HUD changed its race wording in 2024 and
CaseWorthy can change a label at any time; silent recategorization would turn a
vendor wording change into quiet data corruption. A configurable source-value →
CSBG-value crosswalk is planned to close this properly.

### Unsettled: one row per client, or one per household?

A sample row carries `relationship: "Self"` with `enrolled Member Count: 6` and
the other members flattened into `enrolled Family Members`. Whether the
procedure returns one row per enrolled client or one row per household is **not
established**, and if it is the latter a naive import misses dependents. Nothing
guesses or works around it: both Run sync and Test connection report the row
count and the distinct `relationship` values found, so it can be settled from
real data.

### 401 means three different things

CTAPI answers `401` for three unrelated problems and only the body's prose
separates them, so each gets its own message:

| Body contains | Reported as |
|---|---|
| `missing subscription key` | Subscription key rejected — check the Subscription Key setting. |
| `missing or incorrect ApiKey` | API key rejected — check the API Key setting. |
| `is not available at this time` | Eccovia has not enabled `<name>` for this subscription — **not** a credential problem; contact CaseWorthy support to add the procedure to your execution scope. |

The third is our live state today. None of the three is retried. A `500` comes
back with a literally empty body for an invalid procedure or object, so the
procedure name and its parameter *keys* (never values) are logged alongside any
5xx — otherwise a typo and a server fault are indistinguishable.

## Configuration

Primary: **Settings → Integrations** (admin-only) — base URL, subscription key,
API key, Org ID, page size, stored procedure and its parameters, and the
optional **date range** (below). Saved to the database and applied immediately, no
restart; suits hosted tiers (Apache/Ubuntu, Docker) where staff have no shell
access. Both keys are write-only in the UI (never sent back to the browser,
never audited) and **encrypted at rest** with AES-256-GCM (`src/lib/secrets.ts`).

The encryption key lives **outside** the database — `CSBG_SECRET_KEY`, or
`data/secret.key` generated on first use with mode 0600 — so a database dump or
backup tarball carries no usable credential. If that key is lost or rotated, the
stored keys become unreadable: the settings page says so and staff paste them
again. Page size is clamped to 1..500 server-side as well as in the input.

Fallback: `HMIS_*` environment variables — used when nothing is saved in
Settings; useful for ops-managed installs. Saved settings take precedence;
"Clear saved settings" falls back to the environment.

```
HMIS_BASE_URL=          # optional, default https://api.clienttrack.net
HMIS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=  # Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key
HMIS_API_KEY=           # Authorization: ApiKey <key>
HMIS_ORG_ID=            # optional, User Keys only
HMIS_PAGE_SIZE=         # optional, default 200, max 500 (CRQL only)
HMIS_STORED_PROCEDURE=  # optional; set = the client source, blank = CRQL query
HMIS_STORED_PROCEDURE_PARAMS=  # optional JSON object, default {}
HMIS_DATE_PARAMS=       # optional "StartDate,EndDate" — both required or neither applies
HMIS_DATE_RANGE=        # optional fy | cy | rolling:<days> | <start>..<end>
```

Credentials rest inside the app database (encrypted) or the server's
`.env.local`, on access-restricted machines — satisfying the MOU's
secure-storage condition. Data & Integrations → PA HMIS sync has **Test
connection** (`/auth/test` only, no client data) and **Run sync** (full snapshot
pull + integration pass). Admin-only.

## Sync design (as built)

- **One-way, inbound only. Read-only against CTAPI** — nothing in this codebase
  writes to HMIS.
- Full-snapshot semantics: each run replaces `hmis_clients` wholesale, then
  re-runs the matching pass. Links and review resolutions persist across runs.
- Field-name-tolerant normalization (`normalizeHmisClient`) accepts
  PascalCase / camelCase / snake_case spellings; rows without an ID or name
  are dropped, as is `ClientID` 0.
- Paging ends on the first short page, with a 200-page backstop. A pull that
  filled exactly one page and then hit an empty one is **reported as ambiguous**
  rather than as a complete snapshot — see open question 1.
- Request timeout of 20 s, at most 3 attempts, backoff between them.
- All syncs, links, and dismissals write `audit_log` rows. Neither key appears
  in an audit row, an error message, or a log line at any level.

## Open questions for PA HMIS / Eccovia

1. **Does `TOP n` bound the result set before `pageNo` applies?** Every live
   read so far was a single page, so this is untested. If `TOP` binds first,
   page 2 comes back empty and a statewide pull silently stops at one page.
   Cheapest check (read-only, one call): `SELECT TOP 5 ClientID FROM cmClient`
   with `pageSize=5&pageNo=2` — rows back means paging works inside `TOP`; empty
   means multi-page pulls need a keyset walk (`WHERE ClientID > <last>`)
   instead. Until it is answered, `runHmisSync` flags a one-page pull.
2. **Row determinism without `ORDER BY`** — confirm `shouldCache=true` is the
   intended mechanism for keeping a multi-page pull from repeating or skipping
   rows, given that `Order By ClientID` timed out.
3. **Which issued value is which.** We hold an "access key alias" and an "access
   security key" — apparently the Access-record pair behind
   `Authorization: ApiKey`. Confirm whether a separate
   `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` was issued; if not, that is a procurement gap,
   not a code gap.
4. **The unverified `cmClient` column names** in `CRQL_CLIENT_FIELDS` — DOB
   above all, since without it every unmatched person stays snapshot-only
   instead of being imported.
5. **Which CRQL entity holds enrollments/services and family members.** They are
   not `cmClient` columns, so under CRQL the `services` and `household` lists
   arrive empty: imported clients get `hhSize` 1 and today's date as the
   enrollment date instead of the first service date. Likely a Query Designer
   stored procedure.
6. **Whether our key type needs `OrgId`** — a User Key may make it effectively
   required rather than optional.
7. **Rate limits for the initial backfill**, and whether the list should filter
   on `ActiveStatus` rather than merely select it.
8. **Whether the procedure has an internal date window of its own.** The
   parameter names are settled — `StartDate` and `EndDate`, confirmed with the
   HMIS engineer — and CAP Trellis now sends a period on every sync (below). What
   is still unknown is whether the SQL *also* filters internally, because that
   filter would apply underneath whatever we send. It matters: if the procedure
   narrows to, say, the last 90 days regardless, then asking for FY2025 returns
   only the overlap, the sync records FY2025 as covered, and the missing months
   are never pulled again without a deliberate re-sync. Confirm before relying on
   the coverage record for a backfill.

## Reporting period (per sync)

Each sync asks for one period and records it. Applies to the stored procedure
only — the CRQL query carries no `WHERE` clause, so a period set while CRQL is
the client source is inert and both the sync panel and the settings form say so.

**Parameter names** are configuration (Settings → Integrations), defaulting to
the confirmed `StartDate`/`EndDate`. Both are required: with one, the procedure
would apply its own default to the other end, and a half-specified window is
harder to notice than none. A literal date left in the parameters JSON under one
of those names is shadowed by the period and reported, so a leftover cannot
quietly override what the sync asked for.

**The window is chosen per run** on Data & integrations, with quick picks for
last full month, fiscal year to date (the agency's FY start month, matching
Reports), and calendar year to date. It is deliberately *not* stored: the point
is that each run covers a stated period and the history records which.

### Coverage — how a repeat is prevented

A completed sync writes its window to `import_jobs.hmis_start` / `hmis_end`.
That row **is** the coverage record; there is no separate table, so undoing a
sync frees its period along with the records it created — after an undo, that
period genuinely is not covered.

The next sync subtracts every stored period from the request
(`subtractRanges`, `assessCoverage` in `src/lib/hmis-dates.ts`; adjacency
counts, so Jan 1–31 followed by Feb 1–28 is one unbroken stretch, not two with a
phantom gap between them):

| Request vs coverage | What happens |
|---|---|
| No overlap | pulled as asked |
| Exactly or fully covered | **refused**, naming the periods that cover it |
| Partly covered, one gap left | **narrowed to the gap**, and the result says so |
| Partly covered, several gaps | refused, listing the gaps to run one at a time |

The multi-gap case is refused rather than looped because one click should not
fan out into several production calls against PA HMIS. A checkbox forces a
re-sync of an already-covered period, for data corrected on the HMIS side.

### Snapshot semantics: merge, not replace

`hmis_clients` **upserts on `hmis_id`**. It used to be deleted and reinserted
wholesale, which was correct while every sync pulled everything — but with
per-period syncing a full replace would drop every earlier period's rows, and
the organization-wide unduplicated total on `/reports` would silently reflect
only the most recent window. Upserting keeps prior periods and refreshes anyone
a later pull sees again.

## Disposition of electronic files (MOU condition)

The snapshot lives inside the app database only. To end the arrangement: stop
the sync (Settings → Integrations → **Clear saved settings**, and remove any
`HMIS_*` env settings) and clear the snapshot
(`DELETE FROM hmis_clients; DELETE FROM hmis_reviews;`) — coordinate final
disposition with PA DCED as the MOU requires. Linkage rows in
`client_external_ids` contain only opaque IDs.
